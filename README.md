### The Html Essentials 

#### Introduction

    - **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
    - HTML consists of a series of **elements**, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. 
    - The enclosing **tags** can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.
