### The Html Essentials 

#### Introduction

- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
- HTML consists of a series of **elements**, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. 
- The enclosing **tags** can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.

The anatomy of our element is:

- **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
- **The content**: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
- **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

- **<b> - Bold Element** => The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.

- **<br> - Line Break Element** => The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

- **<p> </p> - Paragraph element** =>The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

- **<h1> </h1> - Heading element** => The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.
    - Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <h1> represents the main heading, <h2> represents subheadings, <h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.
    - For example, in this story, the <h1> element represents the title of the story, the <h2> elements represent the title of each chapter, and the <h3> elements represent sub-sections of each chapter.
    - Preferably, you should use a single <h1> per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.
    - Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <h3> elements to represent subheadings, followed by <h2> elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.
    - Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary.
