<h1>Chicken</h1>
<p>
    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
    such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
    for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
    adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the study of
    the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
    (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
    eggs) and as pets.

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.</p>

<p>Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as a
    species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fow</p>

<h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
<p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed
    feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those
    of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
    pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or
    eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and
    female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or
    cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other
    fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and
    combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several
    chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard</p>

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<h4>Social behaviour</h4>
<p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs
    and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order', with
    dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
    causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
    younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.</p>
<h4>Vocalizations</h4>
<p>When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well
    as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and
    encourage them to eat.

    A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[37]
    However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

    Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls
    when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[38]</p>
